 **Brian Tracy’s Time Management Principle No. 7: 
	 *“Time Log (Where is all your time going?)”**

---

## 🧠 **What Brian Tracy Means by “Time Log (Where is all your time going?)”**

This principle is about **tracking how you actually spend your time every day** — not how you _think_ you're spending it.

> 💬 In simple words:  
> **“Write down everything you do during the day, hour by hour, to find out where your time is really going.”**

Just like how a budget tracks where your money goes, a **time log** tracks where your time goes.  
This helps you discover:

- Time-wasters
    
- Unnecessary tasks
    
- Hidden productivity gaps
    
- Opportunities to improve

## 🕵️‍♂️ **Why Use a Time Log?**

Most people **underestimate** how much time they waste.

- Scrolling social media
    
- Checking messages
    
- Doing low-value tasks
    
- Switching between things
    

By keeping a time log, you’ll get an **honest, detailed picture** of your daily habits — and how much time you actually spend on focused work.

## 📋 **How to Keep a Time Log (Step by Step)**

### 🕒 Step 1: Choose a time-tracking method

You can use:

- A notebook
    
- A spreadsheet
    
- A time-tracking app (e.g., Toggl, Clockify, RescueTime)
    

### ✍️ Step 2: Log your time

Every **15–30 minutes**, write down:

- What you were doing
    
- How long it took
    

Example:

|Time|Activity|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|9:00 – 9:30 AM|Checking email|Low priority|
|9:30 – 10:15 AM|Writing report|High focus|
|10:15 – 10:45 AM|Watching YouTube|Distracted|

### 📊 Step 3: Review at the end of the day/week

Ask:

- How much time went to high-value tasks?
    
- How much was wasted?
    
- What can I remove or change?
