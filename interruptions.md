 **Brian Tracy's Time Management Principle No. 11: -
	  *"Interruptions (telephones and walk-in visitors)"*

---

## 🧠 **What Brian Tracy Means by "Interruptions"**

This principle is about **identifying and controlling interruptions** — especially from:

- 📞 **Phone calls**
    
- 🚪 **Walk-in visitors** (people dropping by unexpectedly)
    

> These types of interruptions **break your concentration**, reduce productivity, and **waste time** — often without you realizing it.

---

## 📉 **Why Interruptions Are a Problem**

- Every time you’re interrupted, your brain **shifts focus**.
    
- It takes time to **refocus and return** to deep work.
    
- Too many interruptions can **destroy your workflow** and leave you feeling exhausted, yet unproductive.
    

### 🔁 Example:

Imagine you’re writing code or a report, and:

- A phone call comes in.
    
- After the call, a coworker drops by to chat.
    
- Then your brain needs 10–20 minutes to get back into the zone.

## 📌 **Brian Tracy's Suggested Strategies**

Here’s how Brian Tracy recommends managing interruptions effectively:

### 1. **Set “Quiet Hours”**

- Block off focus time where you silence your phone and avoid meetings.
    
- Example: 9 AM – 11 AM is focus time.
    

### 2. **Use Voicemail and Call Back Later**

- Let non-urgent calls go to voicemail.
    
- Return calls at set times, not randomly throughout the day.
    

### 3. **Politely Control Walk-ins**

- Stand up when someone walks in — signals the conversation will be short.
    
- Say: “Can we talk in 30 minutes? I’m in the middle of something.”
    

### 4. **Train Others**

- Let your team, friends, or family know you have dedicated focus hours.
