**Brian Tracy’s Time Management Principle No. 5: 
	*"Concentration (learn how)”* 

---

## 🧠 **What Brian Tracy Means by "Concentration (learn how)"**

This principle is all about **focusing 100% of your attention on one task at a time** — and training yourself to stay with it until it’s done or until you've made major progress.

> In simple words:  
> **“Learn how to shut out distractions and give your full attention to the most important task until it’s finished.”**

Brian Tracy says that your **ability to concentrate** is one of the **most powerful tools** for getting things done quickly and effectively.

## 🔍 Why Concentration Is So Important

Most people:

- Multitask,
    
- Constantly check their phones,
    
- Get distracted every few minutes.
    

As a result, they:

- Work more slowly,
    
- Make more mistakes,
    
- Feel mentally drained.
    

**Concentration** allows you to:

- Enter a **deep focus state** (also called "flow"),
    
- Complete tasks faster,
    
- Improve the **quality** of your work.

## 📌 Key Practices to Build Concentration

Brian Tracy recommends learning how to:

### 1. **Work on One Thing at a Time**

- Don’t multitask — it reduces performance.
    
- Focus on your top priority task only.
    

### 2. **Use Time Blocks**

- Set a timer (e.g. 50 minutes) to work without checking messages or switching tasks.
    
- After that, take a short break.
    

### 3. **Eliminate Distractions**

- Turn off notifications.
    
- Put your phone on silent or in another room.
    
- Use noise-canceling headphones if necessary.
    

### 4. **Prepare Your Workspace**

- Clean desk = clean mind.
    
- Remove anything unrelated to your current task.
    

### 5. **Start Immediately**

- Don’t wait for "motivation."
    
- Discipline and habit create focus — not feelings.
