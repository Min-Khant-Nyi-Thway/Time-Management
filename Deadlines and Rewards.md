 **Brian Tracy’s Time Management Principle No. 6:
	  *“Deadlines and Rewards (positive logical consequences)”*

---

## 🧠 **What Brian Tracy Means by “Deadlines and Rewards (positive logical consequences)”**

This principle is about **motivating yourself** through two important tools:

1. **Deadlines** – Setting a specific **time limit** to complete a task
    
2. **Rewards** – Giving yourself a **positive consequence** when you complete it
    

> 💬 In simple words:  
> **“Give yourself a finish line… and a prize for crossing it.”**

Brian Tracy says this combo helps create **urgency** (to fight procrastination) and **motivation** (to encourage consistent effort).

## 🕒 **1. Deadlines: Why They Work**

- A deadline **pushes you to take action** now, not later.
    
- It helps you avoid Parkinson’s Law:
    
    > “Work expands to fill the time available for its completion.”
    

✅ When you set a tight deadline, you focus more, work faster, and avoid distractions.

---

## 🏆 **2. Rewards: Why They Work**

- Rewards create **positive reinforcement** — your brain learns that hard work leads to good feelings.
    
- They keep your motivation up, especially for long or boring tasks.
    

🎁 Rewards can be simple:

- A snack
    
- A 15-minute break
    
- Watching an episode of your favorite show
    
- Going for a walk
    
- Buying yourself a small treat

## 📌 **Real-Life Example**

**Goal:** Finish a 5-page report for your freelance project.

### Without a deadline or reward:

- You delay it for days.
    
- You feel unmotivated.
    
- You end up rushing or missing the deadline.
    

### With Brian Tracy’s approach:

- ⏰ You set a deadline: “I’ll finish this by 3:00 PM today.”
    
- 🏅 You promise a reward: “If I finish, I’ll relax with coffee and a movie afterward.”
    

Now, you have both **pressure** and **incentive** — two powerful tools.

## 💡 **How to Apply This Principle**

1. **Break tasks into small parts**  
    → Set mini-deadlines for each part
    
2. **Write your deadlines down**  
    → Use a planner, calendar, or app
    
3. **Choose realistic rewards**  
    → Something small but enjoyable
    
4. **Stay honest**  
    → Only reward yourself if you **actually finish** the task

## 🧠 **Summary in Simple Words**

Brian Tracy is saying:

> “You will get more done when you **set a time limit** and give yourself a **reward** for finishing. This creates a natural push to take action and builds motivation.”
