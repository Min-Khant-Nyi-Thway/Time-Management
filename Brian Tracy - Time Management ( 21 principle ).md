Anybody can be far more successful at life or anything that you want if you will simply learn how and practice that over and over again until it becomes a habit. 

Now no matter what field you're in, no matter what field of endeavor, no matter what work, no matter what activity there is one thing that all successful people have in common is that they are good time managers, and the reason they are good time managers is because they recognize that time management is life management,
it is personal management, I have never seen an example in the hundreds thousands of biographies and autobiographies.

I've studied of successful men and women where the individual has not been well organized and efficient and valued and used their times well successful people winners use their time well the losers do not.

you use these ideas systematically you can increase your personal productivity by 2 or 3 hours a day, you can increase your income, you can increase your rate of promotion, you can increase your life satisfaction, you can even increase the length of time you live.

The question is how badly do you want to learn, how to manage your time well, how much effort are you willing to put into it because the key to time management is self discipline.
