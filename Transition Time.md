**Brian Tracy’s Time Management Principle No. 16: 
	*“Transition Time (Learn More to Earn More)”**

---

## 🧠 **What Brian Tracy Means by “Transition Time (Learn More to Earn More)”**

This principle is about **using the small "in-between" moments in your day to learn and grow**, especially by feeding your mind with new knowledge.

> 💬 In simple words:  
> **“Turn dead time into learning time — so you can grow your skills, grow your value, and grow your income.”**

**Transition time** includes moments like:

- Commuting to work
    
- Waiting in line
    
- Exercising
    
- Doing house chores
    
- Sitting in traffic
    

Instead of wasting these moments, Tracy suggests **using them to listen to audiobooks, podcasts, or educational materials**.

## 🔁 **Why “Transition Time” Matters**

We all have **unused time** scattered throughout the day. Brian Tracy believes this is one of the biggest hidden opportunities for self-improvement and success.

He often says:

> “The average person can become an expert in their field in 3 years just by listening to audio programs during their commute.”

That means **you don’t need extra time — you just need to use your existing transition time better**.
