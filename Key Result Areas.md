 **Brian Tracy’s Time Management Principle No. 12: 
	 *“Key Result Areas (What Key Results Have You Been Hired to Accomplish?)”**  

---

## 🧠 **What Brian Tracy Means by "Key Result Areas"**

This principle is all about **clarity and focus**.

Brian Tracy says that to manage your time well, you need to clearly understand:

> **“What results am I responsible for delivering?”**

These are your **Key Result Areas (KRAs)** — the **core outcomes** you are hired (or expected) to achieve in your role.

They are **not just tasks**, but **end results** that define your success.

If you're not clear on your KRAs, you may stay busy doing a lot of work — but **not the right work**.

---

## 🔍 **Why This Matters in Time Management**

You only have limited time and energy each day.

If you focus on your **key results**, you're being effective. If you focus on **non-essential work**, you're just being busy.

Knowing your KRAs helps you:

- Prioritize the right tasks
    
- Say “no” to distractions
    
- Measure your success clearly
    
- Use your time to produce value
    

> “You are not paid for how busy you are. You’re paid for the **results** you deliver.”

## 🧠 **How to Apply Brian Tracy’s Advice**

### ✔️ Do This:

1. **Ask your boss or team:**
    
    > “What are the top 3–5 results I’m expected to deliver in this role?”
    
2. **Write down your KRAs clearly.**  
    They should be measurable and focused on **results**, not just tasks.
    
3. **Review them weekly.**  
    Ask yourself:
    
    > “What did I do this week to make progress in each KRA?”
    
4. **Use them to set daily priorities.**  
    Only do tasks that move your KRAs forward.
    
5. **Evaluate performance regularly.**  
    Use your KRAs as the standard for personal improvement.

### ❌ Avoid This:

- Confusing “being busy” with “being effective”
    
- Doing work just because it’s easy or urgent
    
- Ignoring feedback from your manager or team
    
- Letting meetings, emails, or small tasks take over your day

## 📌 **Summary in Simple Words**

Brian Tracy is saying:

> “You’re paid for specific results — not for how many hours you work. So figure out **what your most important results are**, and focus your time on achieving them.”

This principle helps you work smarter, not harder.
