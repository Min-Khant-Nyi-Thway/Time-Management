 **Brian Tracy’s Time Management Principle No. 15: 
	 *“Chunks of Time (Allow Time for Important Work)”**

---

## 🧠 **What Brian Tracy Means by “Chunks of Time”**

This principle is about **setting aside large, uninterrupted blocks of time** — or "chunks" — to focus on your **most important, high-value work**.

> You can’t do deep, meaningful work in 5-minute bursts.  
> You need **focused time blocks** to make real progress.

Brian Tracy emphasizes that **important tasks (like writing, planning, learning, or strategic thinking)** require longer periods of concentration — not scattered attention.

## 🔍 **Why This Principle Matters**

Most people’s days get eaten up by:

- Meetings,
    
- Emails,
    
- Small urgent tasks,
    
- Interruptions…
    

As a result, they **never make time** for what really matters (like building a business, writing a book, improving skills, etc.).

Brian Tracy’s point is:

> “If you don’t block out time for your most valuable work, it won’t happen.”

You must **protect and schedule** big blocks of time for top-priority work — or you'll stay stuck doing low-level busywork.

## 🧠 **How to Apply Brian Tracy’s Advice**

### ✔️ Do This:

1. **Pick 1–2 most important tasks** each day.
    
2. **Schedule time blocks** of 60–90 minutes (or more) to focus only on those.
    
3. **Eliminate distractions** (turn off notifications, close your door).
    
4. **Treat the time as sacred** — like a meeting with your future success.
    
5. **Use a timer** if needed (e.g., Pomodoro: 50 minutes work, 10-minute break).
    

> 💡 Tip: Try to schedule your most focused work during your **peak energy hours** (e.g., morning for most people).

---

### ❌ Avoid This:

- Working on big tasks in 10-minute bursts between other things.
    
- Letting calls, emails, or coworkers interrupt your deep work time.
    
- Skipping time blocking and hoping “you’ll find time later.”
    
- Multitasking during your focus blocks — it ruins effectiveness.

## 📌 **Summary in Simple Words**

Brian Tracy is saying:

> “You need big, focused chunks of time to do big, important things. If you don’t make that time — it won’t happen.”

Small bits of time are good for admin tasks, but **real progress** comes from **dedicated focus** on what matters most.
