 **Brian Tracy’s Time Management Principle No. 8:
	  *“Procrastination (Positive or Negative)”*

---

## 🧠 **What Brian Tracy Means by "Procrastination (Positive or Negative)"**

When we hear **"procrastination"**, we usually think of it as a bad thing — delaying tasks we should be doing.

But Brian Tracy explains that **there are two types**:

### 1. ✅ **Positive Procrastination** (a.k.a. _Creative Procrastination_)

- This means **delaying or avoiding low-value, unimportant tasks** so you can focus on high-priority work.
    
- You're still “procrastinating” — but you’re doing it intentionally and strategically.
    

> 💡 Example:  
> You delay cleaning your desk so you can finish a critical project first.

### 2. ❌ **Negative Procrastination**

- This is when you **put off important tasks** due to fear, laziness, or distraction.
    
- It leads to stress, missed deadlines, and poor results.
    

> 💡 Example:  
> You avoid studying or finishing work by watching YouTube or scrolling social media.

## 🔍 Why This Concept Matters in Time Management

The key idea:

> “You don’t have time for everything — so procrastinate on the **right** things.”

You can’t do everything at once, so you must choose wisely what to delay and what to focus on.  
Brian Tracy calls this **“selective procrastination”** — deciding what to delay on purpose.

## 🧠 **How to Apply Brian Tracy’s Advice**

### ✔️ Do This:

1. **Make a to-do list** sorted by importance (not urgency).
    
2. **Identify low-value tasks** you can intentionally delay or skip.
    
3. **Focus all your effort on top-priority tasks** — the ones with real impact.
    
4. Use the question:
    
    > “What is the most valuable use of my time right now?”
    

### ❌ Avoid This:

- Telling yourself “I’ll do it later” without a clear reason.
    
- Replacing difficult work with easy, unimportant activities.
    
- Waiting for the “perfect time” to start (it rarely comes).

## 📌 Summary in Simple Words

Brian Tracy is saying:

> “Not all procrastination is bad. In fact, **you should procrastinate** — but only on **low-value, irrelevant tasks**. Just don’t delay what really matters.”

You should **use procrastination as a tool**, not a habit.
