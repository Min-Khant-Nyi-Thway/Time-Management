 **Brian Tracy’s Time Management Principle No. 19: 
	 *“Work Simplification — Systemize the Work Process”** 

---

## 🧠 **What Brian Tracy Means by “Work Simplification — Systemize the Work Process”**

This principle is about **streamlining and organizing your work so you can do it faster, better, and with less effort** — by using systems, tools, and structured methods.

> 💬 In simple words:  
> **“Make your work easier by creating systems, templates, and routines — so you stop wasting time and energy on repeat tasks.”**

Instead of **reinventing the wheel** every day, Brian Tracy suggests that you:

- Identify repetitive tasks
    
- Create simple processes or checklists
    
- Use tools or automation where possible
    

This makes your workflow smoother, reduces mental fatigue, and **boosts your productivity**.

## ⚙️ **Why Work Simplification Is Important**

Most people waste hours every week:

- Doing things manually
    
- Starting from scratch
    
- Switching between tasks inefficiently
    
- Forgetting steps or doing things the hard way
    

Work simplification helps you:

|Benefit|Why It Matters|
|---|---|
|🧠 **Think Less**|Reduces decision fatigue and improves focus|
|⏱️ **Save Time**|You stop repeating steps or doing things inefficiently|
|🧹 **Reduce Clutter**|Clearer processes mean less chaos and rework|
|🚀 **Work Smarter**|You free up time for creative or high-value tasks|
|🧭 **Improve Consistency**|You get repeatable, reliable results every time|

## 📋 **How to Simplify and Systemize Work (Step by Step)**

### 🔍 Step 1: Identify Repetitive Tasks

Look for things you do **daily or weekly**, such as:

- Answering emails
    
- Creating reports
    
- Client onboarding
    
- Social media posting
    
- Team check-ins
    

### 🧱 Step 2: Break Tasks Into Steps

Document the **exact process** for each task.

Example for onboarding a client:

1. Send welcome email
    
2. Share calendar link
    
3. Create client folder
    
4. Schedule kickoff call
    

### 🧰 Step 3: Create Templates, Tools, or Checklists

- Email templates for repeated messages
    
- Checklists for recurring processes
    
- Project templates in tools like Notion, Trello, or Asana
    
- Automation using tools like Zapier, AI, or scheduling apps
    

### ♻️ Step 4: Review and Improve Regularly

- Ask: “Can I automate this?”
    
- Ask: “Can I delegate this?”
    
- Ask: “Can I skip this?”
    

Even small tweaks can **save hours** over time.
