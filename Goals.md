Brian Tracy's **Time Management principle 1** — 
	*"Goals: What is it you want to accomplish?"* 


---

### 🧠 **What Brian Tracy Means by This Statement**

> “Goals: What is it you want to accomplish?”

This statement emphasizes the **importance of clarity**. Before managing your time effectively, you **must first define what your goals are** — clearly, specifically, and measurably.

Without knowing what you want to accomplish:

- You will spend your time reacting to things rather than **intentionally acting** on meaningful tasks.
    
- You risk being **busy but not productive**.
    

**Example:**

- Vague goal: “I want to be successful.”
    
- Clear goal: “I want to earn $3,000 per month as a freelance web developer by December 2025.”
