 **Brian Tracy’s Time Management Principle No. 4:
	  *“Set Priorities (what is relevant and irrelevant? What is the most valuable use of my time, right now?)”** 

---

## 🧠 **What Brian Tracy Means by “Set Priorities”**

After you have:

1. Defined your goals (Principle #1),
    
2. Written a plan (Principle #2),
    
3. Created a task list (Principle #3),
    

…you now need to **set priorities** — meaning:

> **Choose which tasks are the most important to do first.**

He emphasizes **asking yourself constantly**:

> “**What is the most valuable use of my time, right now?**”

And also:

> “**What is relevant to my goals? What is irrelevant or a distraction?**”

## 🧭 **Why Prioritizing Is Essential**

Not all tasks are equally valuable.

- Some tasks move you **closer to your goal** (high priority).
    
- Others **feel urgent** but don’t really matter (low priority or distractions).
    

**Without priorities, you may stay busy but not productive.**

## ✅ **Example**

Let’s say your goal is:

> “Find a job as a junior web developer in 3 months.”

You made a task list like:

- Polish resume
    
- Apply for jobs
    
- Watch YouTube tutorials
    
- Rearrange desktop folders
    
- Chat with friends about careers
    
- Check LinkedIn
    

### 🔥 Prioritizing would look like:

**High Priority:**

- Polish resume
    
- Apply for jobs
    
- Check LinkedIn
    

**Low Priority:**

- Rearranging folders
    
- Watching random tutorials
    
- Casual chatting
    

Only the **high-priority tasks** are relevant to your immediate goal.

## 🛠️ **Brian Tracy’s Tools for Prioritizing**

### 1. **The 80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle)**

> 80% of your results come from 20% of your tasks.  
> 👉 Focus on that 20% that gives the most results.

### 2. **ABCDE Method**

Label your tasks:

- **A** = Must do. Serious consequences if not done.
    
- **B** = Should do. Mild consequences.
    
- **C** = Nice to do. No consequences.
    
- **D** = Delegate. Someone else can do it.
    
- **E** = Eliminate. Waste of time.
