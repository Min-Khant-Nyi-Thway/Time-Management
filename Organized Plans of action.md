**Brian Tracy’s Time Management Principle No. 2 -
	*“Plans of Action (put it in writing)”**

## 🧠 **What Brian Tracy Means by “Plans of Action (put it in writing)”**

Once you’ve set your **goals** (which is Principle No. 1), the next step is to **create a clear written plan** on **how** you’re going to achieve those goals.

> **“A goal without a plan is just a wish.”**

**In simple terms:**  
Brian Tracy says that **writing down your plan of action** gives you direction, commitment, and control over your time. You no longer just “hope” to achieve something — you now have a step-by-step path to follow.

## 🛠️ **What a Written Plan of Action Looks Like**

Let’s say your goal is:

> “Become a freelance web developer earning $3,000/month within 6 months.”

### 📝 A written plan might include:

1. Research freelance platforms (Day 1–2)
    
2. Build a portfolio website (Week 1)
    
3. Create 3 project samples (Week 2–3)
    
4. Set up profiles on Upwork, Fiverr (Week 4)
    
5. Apply to 5 jobs per day (Week 5 onward)
    

Now you’re not guessing what to do — you have a **concrete action list**.
