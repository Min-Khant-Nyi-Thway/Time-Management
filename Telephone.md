 **Brian Tracy’s Time Management Principle No. 17: 
	 *“Telephone — A Powerful Business Tool”**

---

## 🧠 **What Brian Tracy Means by “Telephone — A Powerful Business Tool”**

This principle is about **using the telephone (or now, smartphones and video calls) as an intentional and efficient tool for productivity**, not as a distraction.

> 💬 In simple words:  
> **“Use phone calls to build relationships, close deals, and solve problems fast — but don’t let it become a time-waster.”**

Brian Tracy sees the telephone as a **double-edged sword**:

- ✅ It can **save time, build trust**, and accelerate business.
    
- ❌ It can also **waste hours** through unplanned, long, or unfocused calls.
    

So the key is to **control your use of the phone** — and use it strategically.

- **Build relationships and trust**
    
- **Get instant answers**
