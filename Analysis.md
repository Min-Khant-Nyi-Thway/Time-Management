 **Brian Tracy’s Time Management Principle No. 3:
	*"Analysis (make a list)”**

## 🧠 **What Brian Tracy Means by “Analysis (make a list)”**

After setting goals (**Principle #1**) and writing a plan of action (**Principle #2**), the next step is to **analyze your tasks** by **making a list**.

> In other words: "Break down your plan into detailed, specific tasks you need to do — and write them into a daily or weekly to-do list."

### ⚙️ The Key Idea:

You can’t manage your time well **unless you know exactly what you’re supposed to do**. A written list helps you:

- See everything at once
    
- Sort tasks by priority
    
- Take control of your day

## 🧩 **What This Looks Like in Practice**

Let’s say your goal is:

> “Build a portfolio website in one week.”

### 🔍 Your analysis (task list) might look like:

- Choose domain name
    
- Write homepage content
    
- Design layout in Figma
    
- Set up hosting
    
- Code the homepage
    
- Add portfolio projects
    
- Create contact form
    
- Test on mobile and desktop
    

You’ve **analyzed** the goal into clear steps and **listed** them — now it’s easier to act.

## 📝 Brian Tracy’s Tips on List-Making

1. **Start each day with a fresh list.**
    
    - Review and update your task list every morning (or the night before).
        
2. **Use the 80/20 Rule.**
    
    - 20% of your tasks often give 80% of your results — **focus on those first**.
        
3. **Apply the ABCDE Method.**
    
    - A = must do, B = should do, C = nice to do, D = delegate, E = eliminate.
        
4. **Always write your list down.**
    
    - Don't keep it in your head — use paper or digital tools.
